I don't know why people talk
Get the biggest feeling in your life
People come and people go
See the biggest feeling in your life
Oh when you're looking down
And you're on the floor
Everybody feels the way I feel
Oh nothing you can change
Or you can do
And all the world to you
Just seems so blue

Why did you do the thing Baby
Do the thing Baby
Why did you do the thing Baby
Do the thing Baby

You are, you are my world
You are, you are my world
You are, you are my world
You are, you are my world

I don't know what people say
Never stop believing in your life
Broken dreams with tragic scenes
See the biggest sorrow in your eyes
Oh when you're looking down
And you're on the floor
Everybody feels the way I feel
Oh nothing you can change
Or you can do
And all the world to you
Just seems so blue
